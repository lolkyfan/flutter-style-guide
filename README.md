### File Names
Source file names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Source files end with a `.dart` extension.

Examples:
- A file containing a single class `MyClass` is named `my_class.dart`
- A barrel file containing source file exports is named after a prulalized common ancestor name (if possible) like `models.dart`
